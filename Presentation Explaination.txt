1.Cryptomining and Cryptojacking:

Cryptomining involves performing complex computational tasks to obtain cryptocurrency.

Cryptojacking is the unauthorized use of someoneâ€™s computer to mine cryptocurrency without their permission.

2.Impact of Cryptojacking:

Cryptojacking affects large businesses, as seen with incidents involving Tesla and Jenkins.

It leads to increased power consumption, decreased performance, and potential damage to hardware.

3.Monero vs. Bitcoin:

Monero is often used in cryptojacking because it can be mined through multiple computational resources, unlike Bitcoin, which requires specialized hardware.

Monero provides better privacy compared to Bitcoin, making it appealing for malicious purposes.

4.Tools like Coinhive:

Coinhive is a JavaScript library used to mine Monero directly from browsers.

Although Coinhive was intended as a legitimate revenue source, it became widely used for cryptojacking due to the lack of enforced user permission or CPU throttling.

5.Defensive Measures:

Blocking cryptomining can be achieved through browser extensions like AdBlock Plus, NoCoin, and MinerBlock.

Monitoring CPU usage and performance can help detect cryptojacking activities.

6.Challenges in Detection:

Cryptojackers have evolved to use proxy networks, making detection more difficult.

Extensions like MinerBlock not only block known scripts but also monitor for cryptomining behavior.

7.Potential Legitimate Uses:

In-browser cryptomining could be a legitimate source of revenue for websites if implemented responsibly, with user consent and minimal impact on device performance
